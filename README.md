# Code Chrysalis Algorithms Meetup!

Let's make our heads hurt :)

## Meetup Rules

Our meetup is welcome to algorithm lovers of all languages AND levels. We want this to be a space where people can work through fun algos together and learn from each other.

* Be kind and considerate to everyone's questions and answers
* Be encouraging, helpful, and patient to those who have less knowledge/experience than you
* Ask questions and listen to those who have more knowledge/experience than you
* There are many ways of solving these algorithms, so please be open to other possibilities

## Rating System

The higher the number, the harder the algorithm.

Algorithms are rated from 1 to 5.

Roughly speaking...

1 = Great for those just getting started with coding
2 = Simple
3 = Medium
4 = Medium, some CS knowledge probably helps
5 = Hard, some CS knowledge probably helps
